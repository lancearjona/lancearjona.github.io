<h2>Computer Forensics Part 3</h2>

<body>
    <h3>Presentation</h3>
    <p>The Presentation phase has the examiner showcase their report on what they found. The exmainer needs to remove any jargon from the report for listener to understand in the event they do not know the terminology being used. They will have meetings in order to clarify and go in depth with their report. Having them present their report will usually clear up any misunderstandings as they can answer questions and stop to clarify any issues.</p>

    <h3>Review</h3>
    <p>The review phase is straight forward, going over the event. What was the issue? Where was the security breach? How can we fix the flaw? How can we prevent this from happening in the future? How can we prepare for the future to prevent this from happening again? What did we learn and how can we be prepared in the future to make the process faster and efficient as possible?</p>
