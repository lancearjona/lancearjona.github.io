<h2>SQL injection</h2>

<body>
    <p>SQL Injection is another attack to get into websites in order to steal personal information. Where the attacker sends a clause onto an unsuspecting user in order to fish for their credentials. I was a victim to this due to a Yahoo breach and they got into my account and made several purchases using my saved credit card information. In order to combat this, users should always have 2 factor authentication in order to buff up their security on their accounts. Another way they steal credentials is being able to display pages in plaintext in order to see the password the userr is using and copy it down and use it for future reference. This is a vulnerability in the server side where the attacker is able to inject code and have it reveal sensitive information </p>
