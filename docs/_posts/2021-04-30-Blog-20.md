<h2>Firewalls</h2>

<body>
    <p>Firewalls are a way to filter out wanted or unwanted network traffic by either white or blacklisting them into the network. Like a gatekeeper that will allow or deny people access to pass through. The firewall can also explain why the packet was rejected or dropped. This can also be a vulnerability by explaining to attackers giving them an entry point into your network. Going back to the gatekeeper example, lets say the gatekeeper denied an attacker access to their kingdom. Reason being they were not wearing a blue shirt, the attacker can later come back with a blue shirt and once inside the kingdom, they can cause internal damage from the inside of the kingdom and may be difficult to figure out why such a thing happened. Had the firewall given less information to the person trying to gain access to the network, the attacker may have never gotten inside the network. With the firewall, owners can customize who can and can not enter using the setting criteria they set in order filter out unwanted traffic.</p>
