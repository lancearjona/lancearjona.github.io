<h2>XSS Cross Site Scripting</h2>

<body>
    <p>XSS Cross is an injection type attack that inserts javascript code into a site that may require user input. This only happens to sites that are vulnerable and does not reject input that may be invalid. For example, if the website is requiring me to input my username, but does not double check that a user or attacker is inputting a valid username and not code into the username bar, it may accept and run the code instead of rejecting the input. Think of a bouncer working the entrance of a club, they can allow or deny entry of someone that does not meet the club's dresscode or may be underaged. Now lets say that the bouncer allows everyone to enter the club without filtering them out. Now that a malicious person is inside the club, they can implement their attack. Just like a website, if they do not reject input that does not meet the input's requirements and allows malicious code to run on the site, the website may either, lose information and be held for ransom, every users' personal information now in the hands of a malicious individual, or even destroy the website.</p>
