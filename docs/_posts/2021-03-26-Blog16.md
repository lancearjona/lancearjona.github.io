<h2>Bootstrap</h2>

<body>
    <p>I learned about the wonders of Bootstrap and how much easier it is to create and format a website with it is. There are different ways to implement bootstrap but there were two I used to get started for the group project. First was being able to get the site formatted using the grid which is divided into twevles. Any format combination adding up to 12 can be used to evenly space out a website using text or media to make the site more appealing and responsive. MY favorite formatting was 3/3/3/3 and 4/4/4 to evenly space out media to my liking in order to evenly space things out. Bootstrap also has the option to use free templates that can use to format your website in terms of HTML and CSS where you can easily fill out content without having to worry too much about the formatting in regards to making it a responsive website since the tempalte's CSS covers all the back end work. My favorite part is being able to edit any of the CSS to suite the needs of the website along with being able to take snippets of the HTML and reorganizing it for your own purposes. Lastly, being able to not worry about what device the end user is using, and the website adjusting to the end user's device is what makes bootstrap a powerful tool to be able to not have to spend countless hours coding CSS. </p>
