<h2>CIT 481 Project Thoughts</h2>

<body>
    <p>As the semester is coming to a close and our final project is nearing completion, one of the most confusing parts about the project for me to implement was merging of the HTML and JS codes. At first I did not know you can meld different code languages together in order to output JS code into HTML. At first thought I thought it would be a lot more difficult to implement, but after finding out all you need to do is call the function that calls JS file for the JS file to run. I ran into a bit of issues outputting the data the into HTML code with the mixture of the Bootstrap templates due to misalignment of the code not printing correctly. I found out that paragraph tags in HTML always output a newline, so I had to use a different tag "strong" in order output the data, while also bolding it. For the most part, formatting all the HTML took most of my time since I had to double check where everything was being formatted due to the CSS, it took a lot of trial and error, but we finally got everything formatted to our liking.</p>
