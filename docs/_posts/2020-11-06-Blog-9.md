<h2>Cyber Security</h2>

<body>
    <h3>Distributed Denial-of-Service</h3>
    <p>A Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack is when a legitimate user is being denied service to a website or webserver. This is due to the server not being able to respond to the user since the server is overwhelmed with other requests that are not legitimate and is busy responding to those requests.</p>

    <h4>Botnet</h4>
    <p>Botnet occurs when a user is tricked into installing a trojan or malware onto their device and will be called to send requests to the target victim in order to deny them service by sending requests to the victim's device. Since the victim's device is overloaded by requests it will be delayed to receive legitimate requests since it is busy dealing with the other requests that were sent before it.</p>

    <h4>Exploits</h4>
    <p>This occurs when a server has exploits or vulnerabilities that are being taken advantage of in order to deny service. All a hacker needs to do once inside a server is to wreck havoc by crashing server applications or destroy as much as possible. The best thing to do in this scenario is to disable the server and try to patch it up as soon as possible in order to avoid as much damage as possible and start damage control. </p>
