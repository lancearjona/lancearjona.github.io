<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>
At first I was very intimidated attempting this assignment because I was not 100% sure what I was doing but after seeing the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxua_1vyFck">Youtube link</a> from Samvel Vardanyan I was able to set up the first few steps to this blog.

Once everything was set up I started to play around with the editor and was enjoying seeing the changes I was making in Visual Studio Code being transferred to my browser. It felt like magic. Since I am learning HTML in my CIT 384 class I decided to put it into practice by adding headers, links, and formatting.

<h3>What I Learned</h3>
<p>
This was my first time using Jekyll. The installation was easy and coding it was a breeze since I was already familiar with HTML so I was able implement things I've already learned along with learning something new.

<h3>What I Struggled with</h3>
<p>My biggest struggle was being able syncing my files to my repository. It took me a couple of tries but I as able to do so after following this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrb7Gge9yoE">video</a>. It took me an hour to realize everything was already uploaded since I was getting errors in the terminal and thought I was doing something wrong.</p>

<p>I was struggling with my pages not showing up correctly and not being able to have my page load at all and just getting 404 errors. I spent 7 hours trying to get this running, but after referencing <a href="https://christopher-der.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/09/03/blog-0.html">Chrisâ€™ Blog</a> I was able to get it running in 10-15 minutes if read carefully.</p>
